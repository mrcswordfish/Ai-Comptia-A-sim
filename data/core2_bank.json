Users are unable to log on to the OS: EOL does not prevent logons; it affects support and updates. The OS can no longer be purchased: Sales availability is not the defining characteristic of EOL. New device drivers must be installed immediately: Driver installation is not mandated by EOL; the main issue is lack of updates/support.
